Project: Project 2 (producer and consumer problem with priority dequeues)

Project Overview: This project uses three different priority dequeues (double ended queues) to handle programs. The priority levels are Low, medium, and High. Programs will be moved to a queue simulating a priority based scheduling system where producers will add tasks to the deques (using synchronization) and consumers will remove them based on highest available priority.

Project Structure: 

#KERNAL SPACE#
kdeque.h - Header file for deque structure
kdeque.c - Implementation file for system calls
Makefile - Compiles code (for Kernalspace)

Build and Compile:
cd kernel_space
make
gcc kernel_tests.c -o kernel_tests
./kernel_tests

Kernalspace Driver- Interacts with kernel module using system calls. does priority testing and synchronization with multiple threads.
- Run compiled main.c program directly to execute while compile kernal_tests.c with root privileges after loading kernel module.
