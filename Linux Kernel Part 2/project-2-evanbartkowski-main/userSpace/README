Project: Project 2 (producer and consumer problem with priority dequeues)

Project Overview: This project uses three different priority dequeues (double ended queues) to handle programs. The priority levels are Low, medium, and High. Programs will be moved to a queue simulating a priority based scheduling system where producers will add tasks to the deques (using synchronization) and consumers will remove them based on highest available priority.

Project Structure: 
#USERSPACE#
deque.h: Header that creates definitions and function prototypes
deque.c: Implements deque operations while having synchronization
main.c: Manages producer and consumer threads, initialization, and freeing
Makefile: Compiles code (for userspace)

Build and Compile:
cd userSpace
make
./main



FOR TESTS:
gcc user_tests.c deque.c -o user_tests -lpthread
./user_tests
