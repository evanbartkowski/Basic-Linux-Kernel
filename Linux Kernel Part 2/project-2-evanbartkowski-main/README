Project: Project 2 (producer and consumer problem with priority dequeues)

Project Overview: This project uses three different priority dequeues 
(double ended queues) to handle programs. The priority levels are Low, medium, 
and High. Programs will be moved to a queue simulating a priority based 
scheduling system where producers will add tasks to the deques 
(using synchronization) and consumers will remove them based on highest 
available priority.

Project Structure: 
#USERSPACE#
deque.h: Header that creates definitions and function prototypes
deque.c: Implements deque operations while having synchronization
main.c: Manages producer and consumer threads, initialization, and freeing
Makefile: Compiles code (for userspace)
#KERNAL SPACE#
kdeque.h - Header file for deque structure
kdeque.c - Implementation file for system calls
Makefile - Compiles code (for Kernalspace)

Build and Compile:


cd user_space
make
./main
gcc user_tests.c deque.c -o user_tests -lpthread
./user_tests



cd kernel_space
make
gcc kernel_tests.c -o kernel_tests
./kernel_tests

Driver Overview:
Userspace Driver (Main.c) - initializes dequeues, sets up synchronization 
using semaphores and mutex, simulates producers adding tasks, and consumers 
removing tasks.
Kernalspace Driver- Interacts with kernel module using system calls. does 
priority testing and synchronization with multiple threads.
- Run compiled main.c program directly to execute while compile 
kernal_tests.c with root privileges after loading kernel module.

Issues / Errors:
Keep getting errors trying to use 'make' on kernel code. It from syscalls not being defined.
Must have something to do with tracing but i cannot figure out how to fix it,
even after adding to syscall table, adding to headers, disabling tracing, 
checking for duplicates, and recompiling.
